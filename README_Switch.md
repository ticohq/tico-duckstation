## Installation

This branch builds the GPL Switch port with the Tico overlay enabled for the nogui frontend.

To use it put the switch folder from the 7z file onto the root of your SD card, so that there is a `tico-duckstation` folder inside the `switch` folder.

Alternatively you can also put the tico-duckstation folder wherever you like.

## Building

Requires devkitA64, libnx, deko3D, [my uam fork](https://github.com/RSDuck/uam/tree/library-target) which allows compiling shaders at runtime and the Switch CMake package. Also a bunch of portlibs package I forgot to write down. Install them as errors pop up.

```bash
$ /opt/devkitpro/portlibs/switch/bin/aarch64-none-elf-cmake -G "Ninja" -DBUILD_NOGUI_FRONTEND=ON -DBUILD_QT_FRONTEND=OFF -DENABLE_OPENGL=OFF -DENABLE_VULKAN=OFF -DENABLE_CUBEB=OFF -DCMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS=ON  ../..
```
